E-commerce Recommendation Engine: ETL for user activity, analytics for product affinity, dashboard for marketing
Technologies: Python, Pandas, Mongo, API Data, Matlibplot/Pandas visualzation

Project Overview:
Develop an E-commerce Recommendation Engine pipeline that extracts user activity data from APIs or databases, transforms and cleans the data using Python and Pandas, loads it into MongoDB, analyzes product affinity and user behavior, and visualizes recommendations and marketing KPIs on a dashboard.

Steps:

1. Data Extraction:
    - Use Python scripts to connect to user activity APIs or CSV logs.
    - Fetch data: user ID, product views, clicks, purchases, timestamps, session info.

2. Data Transformation:
    - Clean data: handle missing values, remove duplicates, standardize formats.
    - Use Pandas for feature engineering: session segmentation, product co-occurrence, user profiling.

3. Data Loading:
    - Store transformed data in MongoDB collections for scalable querying.
    - Organize collections by user, product, and session.

4. Analytics & Recommendation:
    - Use Pandas to analyze product affinity: frequently co-viewed/purchased products.
    - Implement simple collaborative filtering: recommend products based on similar user behavior.
    - Calculate KPIs: conversion rates, average order value, top recommended products.

5. Visualization:
    - Build dashboards using Matplotlib or Pandas visualization tools.
    - Display charts: recommendation performance, user engagement, product popularity.
    - Optionally, use Flask/Dash for interactive dashboards.

6. Automation:
    - Schedule ETL pipeline with cron jobs or Python schedulers for regular updates.

Sample Code Snippets:

- Extract user activity data from API:
import requests
import pandas as pd

api_url = "https://api.example.com/user_activity"
params = {
    "start_date": "2024-06-01",
    "end_date": "2024-06-30"
}
response = requests.get(api_url, params=params)
data = response.json()

df = pd.DataFrame(data['activities'])
print(df.head())

- Product affinity analysis:
affinity = df.groupby(['user_id', 'product_id']).size().unstack(fill_value=0)
similarity = affinity.T.corr()
print(similarity)

- Simple recommendation (top co-viewed products):
product_views = df.groupby('product_id')['user_id'].count().sort_values(ascending=False)
recommended = product_views.head(5)
print(recommended)

- Visualization of top recommended products:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

recommended.plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Top Recommended Products')
plt.xlabel('Product ID')
plt.ylabel('Views')
plt.show()
