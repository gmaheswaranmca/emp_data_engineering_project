Retail Sales Data Pipeline: ETL for sales transactions, analytics on trends, dashboard for KPIs.
Technologies: Python, Pandas, Mongo, API Data, Matlibplot/Pandas visualzation

Project Overview:
Build a Retail Sales Data Pipeline that extracts sales transactions from APIs or databases, transforms and cleans the data using Python and Pandas, loads it into MongoDB, performs analytics to identify sales trends, and visualizes KPIs on a dashboard.

Steps:

1. Data Extraction:
    - Use Python scripts to connect to sales transaction APIs or CSV files.
    - Fetch daily/weekly sales data including product, quantity, price, timestamp, store location.

2. Data Transformation:
    - Clean data: handle missing values, remove duplicates, standardize formats.
    - Use Pandas for data manipulation: group by product/category, calculate total sales, average price, etc.

3. Data Loading:
    - Store transformed data in MongoDB collections for scalable access.
    - Structure collections by date, product, and store.

4. Analytics:
    - Use Pandas to analyze trends: top-selling products, sales growth, seasonal patterns.
    - Calculate KPIs: total revenue, average basket size, conversion rates.

5. Visualization:
    - Build dashboards using Matplotlib or Pandas visualization tools.
    - Display charts: sales over time, product/category performance, store comparisons.
    - Optionally, use Flask/Dash for interactive dashboards.

6. Automation:
    - Schedule ETL pipeline with cron jobs or Python schedulers for regular updates.

Sample Code Snippets:

- Extract data from API:
```
import requests
import pandas as pd

# Example: Extract sales data from a REST API
api_url = "https://api.example.com/sales"
params = {
    "start_date": "2024-06-01",
    "end_date": "2024-06-30"
}
response = requests.get(api_url, params=params)
data = response.json()

# Convert to DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data['transactions'])

# Preview extracted data
print(df.head())
```
