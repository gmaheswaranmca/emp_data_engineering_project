Financial Fraud Detection: ETL for transaction data, analytics for fraud patterns, dashboard alerts.
Technologies: Python, Pandas, Mongo, API Data, Matlibplot/Pandas visualzation


Project Overview:
Develop a Financial Fraud Detection pipeline that extracts transaction data from APIs or databases, transforms and cleans the data using Python and Pandas, loads it into MongoDB, analyzes for fraud patterns using statistical and rule-based methods, and visualizes alerts and KPIs on a dashboard.

Steps:

1. Data Extraction:
    - Use Python scripts to connect to transaction APIs or CSV files.
    - Fetch transaction data: transaction ID, amount, timestamp, account info, merchant, location.

2. Data Transformation:
    - Clean data: handle missing values, remove duplicates, standardize formats.
    - Use Pandas for feature engineering: calculate transaction frequency, average amount, time between transactions.

3. Data Loading:
    - Store transformed data in MongoDB collections for scalable querying.
    - Organize collections by account, date, and merchant.

4. Analytics & Fraud Detection:
    - Use Pandas to identify anomalies: unusually large transactions, rapid succession of transactions, location mismatches.
    - Implement rule-based checks (e.g., amount thresholds, blacklisted merchants).
    - Optionally, apply statistical models or machine learning for anomaly detection.

5. Visualization & Alerts:
    - Build dashboards using Matplotlib or Pandas visualization tools.
    - Display charts: flagged transactions over time, fraud patterns by account/merchant.
    - Set up alert notifications for suspicious activity.

6. Automation:
    - Schedule ETL pipeline with cron jobs or Python schedulers for continuous monitoring.

Sample Code Snippets:

- Extract transaction data from API:
import requests
import pandas as pd

api_url = "https://api.example.com/transactions"
params = {
    "start_date": "2024-06-01",
    "end_date": "2024-06-30"
}
response = requests.get(api_url, params=params)
data = response.json()

df = pd.DataFrame(data['transactions'])
print(df.head())

- Simple fraud detection rule:
df['is_suspicious'] = df['amount'] > 10000  # Flag transactions over $10,000
suspicious = df[df['is_suspicious']]
print(suspicious)

- Visualization of suspicious transactions:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.hist(suspicious['amount'], bins=20)
plt.title('Distribution of Suspicious Transaction Amounts')
plt.xlabel('Amount')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()
