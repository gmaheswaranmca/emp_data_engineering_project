Education Performance Tracking: ETL for student records, analytics on grades, dashboard for teachers/admins
Technologies: Python, Pandas, Mongo, API Data, Matlibplot/Pandas visualzation

Project Overview:
Create an Education Performance Tracking pipeline that extracts student records from APIs or databases, transforms and cleans the data using Python and Pandas, loads it into MongoDB, analyzes grades and performance metrics, and visualizes KPIs and trends on a dashboard for teachers and administrators.

Steps:

1. Data Extraction:
    - Use Python scripts to connect to student record APIs or CSV exports.
    - Fetch data: student ID, demographics, grades, attendance, course info, assessment dates.

2. Data Transformation:
    - Clean data: handle missing values, remove duplicates, standardize formats (e.g., date, grade scales).
    - Use Pandas for feature engineering: calculate GPA, attendance rates, encode categorical variables.

3. Data Loading:
    - Store transformed data in MongoDB collections for scalable access.
    - Organize collections by student, course, and academic term.

4. Analytics:
    - Use Pandas to analyze performance: grade distributions, pass/fail rates, attendance impact.
    - Calculate KPIs: average GPA, top-performing students, course completion rates.

5. Visualization:
    - Build dashboards using Matplotlib or Pandas visualization tools.
    - Display charts: grade trends over time, student performance by course, attendance vs. grades.
    - Optionally, use Flask/Dash for interactive dashboards.

6. Automation:
    - Schedule ETL pipeline with cron jobs or Python schedulers for regular updates.

Sample Code Snippets:

- Extract student records from API:
import requests
import pandas as pd

api_url = "https://api.example.com/student_records"
params = {
    "start_date": "2024-06-01",
    "end_date": "2024-06-30"
}
response = requests.get(api_url, params=params)
data = response.json()

df = pd.DataFrame(data['students'])
print(df.head())

- Calculate GPA and attendance rate:
df['gpa'] = df[['grade1', 'grade2', 'grade3']].mean(axis=1)
df['attendance_rate'] = df['days_present'] / df['days_total']
print(df[['student_id', 'gpa', 'attendance_rate']])

- Visualization of grade distribution:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df['gpa'].plot(kind='hist', bins=10)
plt.title('GPA Distribution')
plt.xlabel('GPA')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()
